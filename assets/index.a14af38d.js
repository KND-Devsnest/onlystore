So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this. The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....
