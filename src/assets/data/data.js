        Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.
        Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.
        Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.`,

Face ID is fast and accurate to unlock the device in dark! In low to moderate usage, battery supports 30+ hours and in heavy usage, battery supports 20+ hours. This one doesn't have Adapter and Earphones, but you can buy them separately! Bought for 43K (128GB) during Prime Day Sale! Overall a value for money device! A good device to start if you’re moving to Apple from Android or upgrading from previous generation iPhones. Thank You Apple!",

      At first I was hesitant to buy the book thinking that it would contain the same unbelievable fictional aspects where the gods can fly and cure the incurable diseases by their touch. I was blown away by the simplicity of the protagonist. He didn't have any powers, instead he had the skill and intelligence which led to his rise to become a Mahadev.
      The story is well narrated with twists and turns of comedy, drama, rage and emotions which leaves you hooked till you read the last chapter and then, the other two books. The characters are well developed making you feel their pain and happiness.

The story begins as the people of rural meryton scurry to marry their daughters off to Charles Bingley, a dashing and eligible Bachelor who has taken an estate near the Bennet. At the villagers welcoming ball, Elizabeth meets up with a formidable adversary: bingley’s closest friend, the Cold, prideful, extremely wealthy Fitzwilliam Darcy, who piques her to new heights of antagonism.

Coming from the Nirgun bhakti tradition, the words of this fifteenth-century poet have the power to reach beyond time and speak to us today. Was he a Hindu or Muslim or was he beyond religion? Did he try to cultivate a new faith or did he eschew organised religion altogether? Was his modernity an exception or a reflection of the times he lived in? What does Kabir’s life and poetry tell us about this nation’s past and present? In this rare appraisal of Kabir’s writings and his life, Purushottam Agarwal approaches this timeless poet-revolutionary with little preconceptions, presenting him the way the poet wanted to be seen, rather than what his followers and fans want to see in him.",
